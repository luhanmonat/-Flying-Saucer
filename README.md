What a great use for those multi colored, programmable, LED strips.

A strip of 60 WS8212B programmable LED's was used to create this device.  The ATtiny85 was a perfect match because only one signal line is needed. (see diagram)

As is customary today, you get the source file in Arduino-C.  After constructing one of these - see our YouTube video, you may want to diddle around witht the code.

Have fun,
